To the ears of many Black feminists, this sounds, to be frank, utterly foolish. Here, I identify three metaphilosophical assumptions, i.e. the disaggregation, fundamentality and transcendental assumptions, that aid in underwriting the ability to use the statement, ‘I do race, not gender’, as a means for avoiding gender-based questions in ‘race talks’. Then, I gesture to a reason to reject the fundamentality and transcendental assumptions, i.e. the promotion of intellectual slumming.","title-short":"Word to the Wise","language":"en","DOI":"10.1111/phc3.12268","author":[{"given":"Kristie","family":"Dotson"}],"URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phc3.12268/abstract","container-title":"Philosophy Compass","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017","7","25"]]},"page":"69-74","volume":"11","type":"article-journal","ISSN":"1747-9991"}]
